there are plenty of reasons to criticise nfts,
but i want to focus on the themes of information...
... and scarcity,
because nft goods are primarily information-based,
and typical economic models of scarcity don't (need to) apply to information (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPtNXo4XsAAyLkM.jpg).
most schools of economic thought (https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Table-1-Schools-of-Economic-Thought.jpg)...
... assume that most goods are scarce:
that is, that the demand often exceeds supply,
and that there are costs involved in the production of goods,
such as raw materials,
and time.
but information isn't like cars or bread or people.
because it is intangible, it can be replicated without limit,
and at very little cost, depending on the medium.
despite this, or perhaps as a result of this,
institutions to inhibit the free replication of information have been around for centuries:
patents have existed since at least 1474 (https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/102918-57-History-Copyright-Print-Patent-Invention.png),
and over the years we have seen campaigns around home taping of music (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/thumb/a/ae/Home_taping_is_killing_music.jpg/1200px-Home_taping_is_killing_music.jpg),
and copying of software (https://cdn.artandlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dont_copy_that_floppy.gif).
property rights alone aren't enough for capitalism function,
it also needs scarcity,
because if anyone can access or duplicate a good at minimal cost,
then there is no need for trade or markets.
funding for artistic endeavours is a long-standing problem in society,
and many methods, both public and private, have existed over the years.
but with the extension of copyright terms (http://www.tomwbell.com/writings/(C)_Term.gif),
and the centralisation of ownership (https://12bytes.org/wp-content/uploads/Media-Ownership-2011.png),
the interests of the public, and of future artists,
are being increasingly limited,
in favour of short-term profit gain...
... for a minority of companies.
rather than creating a valuable public domain of our shared cultural heritage,
art has been commodified, and artists are forced to compete for funding and recognition.
art and artistic processes are being forced to fit into preconceived notions of value,
in place of the development of new systems which reward artists for their contributions to society.
nfts are just the latest attempt at commodification,
riding on the coat-tails of the cryptocurrency bubble.
even if nfts are theoretically capable of providing value to artists,
the market for nfts has quickly become entirely speculative,
and this makes nfts currently useless for artists,
because traders are only interested in the mimetic value of artworks,
not their emotional, aesthetic, or critical value.
the implication is that art is only valuable if other people want it,
but some of the most important art...
... is valuable because it contradicts society's values (http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-F6iE2BQ0BfE/UKRPOh46_RI/AAAAAAAAKW8/efyivwjbyHk/s1600/pink-flamingos-pig-portable.jpg).
artists and artistic communities have spoken out in opposition to nfts (https://the-crypto-syllabus.com/brian-eno-on-nfts-and-automatism/)...
... and this trend will continue,
as more artists learn that not only do nfts fail to provide them with a larger audience,
