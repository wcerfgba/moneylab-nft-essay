there are plenty of reasons to criticise nfts,
but i want to focus on the themes of information...
... and scarcity,
because nft goods are primarily information-based,
and typical economic models of scarcity don't (need to) apply to information (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPtNXo4XsAAyLkM.jpg).
most schools of economic thought (https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Table-1-Schools-of-Economic-Thought.jpg)...
... assume that most goods are scarce:
that is, that the demand often exceeds supply,
and that there are costs involved in the production of goods,
such as raw materials,
and time.
but information isn't like cars or bread or people.
because it is intangible, it can be replicated without limit,
and at very little cost, depending on the medium.
despite this, or perhaps as a result of this,
institutions to inhibit the free replication of information have been around for centuries:
patents have existed since at least 1474 (https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/102918-57-History-Copyright-Print-Patent-Invention.png),
and over the years we have seen campaigns around home taping of music (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/thumb/a/ae/Home_taping_is_killing_music.jpg/1200px-Home_taping_is_killing_music.jpg),
and copying of software (https://cdn.artandlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dont_copy_that_floppy.gif).
property rights alone aren't enough for capitalism function,
it also needs scarcity,
because if anyone can access or duplicate a good at minimal cost,
then there is no need for trade or markets.
funding for artistic endeavours is a long-standing problem in society,
