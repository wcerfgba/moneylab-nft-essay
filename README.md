# MoneyLab NFT Essay Prize Entry

This is my (John L. Preston's) entry for the [MoneyLab NFT Essay prize](https://networkcultures.org/moneylab/2022/01/21/moneylab-nft-essay-prize/).

The question to be addressed is: **"Are NFTs the key to a generation's empowerment, or a capitalist trap?"**

This essay has been developed using Git as a narrative medium. This repository contains two text files: `nft-good.md` argues that "NFTs the key to a generation's empowerment" whereas `nft-bad.md` argues that "NFTs are a capitalist trap". Additionally the Git commit messages provide tangential discussion on these issues along with an artist's commentary on the work itself and the development process.

To experience this essay in its intended medium, you should:

1. Clone this Git repository -- `git clone git@github.com:wcerfgba/moneylab-nft-essay.git`
2. Checkout the `mainnet` branch -- `git checkout mainnet`
3. Display the log in reverse order with raw patch and raw commit log -- `git log --patch-with-raw --format=raw`
