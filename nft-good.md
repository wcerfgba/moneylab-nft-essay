Making money as an artist is hard.
This is especially true for digital media artists,
whose work can be easily pirated (https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eVh9-FIQyWQ/V7o302HUHiI/AAAAAAAA1Pc/Go6y-WL_8gcj5SBQ2DL96-J3MCZzxUY3wCLcB/s1600/bandera_pirata_hacker.jpg),
because digital media are computer-based,
and anyone can copy the files and distribute them online.
Today, artists are struggling to make ends meet (https://art.ngfiles.com/images/1005000/1005372_agentslimnsexy_starving-artist.png?f1566806409),
because funding is scarce,
and because the true value of artworks are not known,
due to externalities like piracy,
and the lack of a true market system for artworks.
