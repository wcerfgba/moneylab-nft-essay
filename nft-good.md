Making money as an artist is hard.
This is especially true for digital media artists,
whose work can be easily pirated (https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eVh9-FIQyWQ/V7o302HUHiI/AAAAAAAA1Pc/Go6y-WL_8gcj5SBQ2DL96-J3MCZzxUY3wCLcB/s1600/bandera_pirata_hacker.jpg),
because digital media are computer-based,
and anyone can copy the files and distribute them online.
Today, artists are struggling to make ends meet (https://art.ngfiles.com/images/1005000/1005372_agentslimnsexy_starving-artist.png?f1566806409),
because funding is scarce,
and because the true value of artworks are not known,
due to externalities like piracy,
and the lack of a true market system for artworks.
NFTs are revolutionary,
because they provide a common market for trading digital goods,
which means anyone can now access the power of the market (http://welkerswikinomics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/market-power-11.jpeg):
it's easy for people to mint an NFT and trade it with others (https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2021/06/How-to-Mint-an-NFT-The-Photographers-Guide-800x420.jpg),
and people who purchase NFTs can re-sell them later.
People have been trading art for a long time (https://i1.wp.com/fieneleunissen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Portfolio-webpage.jpg?fit=1056%2C672&ssl=1),
but since the rise of the Internet, a need has emerged...
... to provide digital artists with the same levels of security...
