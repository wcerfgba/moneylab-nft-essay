Making money as an artist is hard.

NFTs don't require a blockchain,
or a cryptocurrency.
Really they're just machine-readable receipts.

NFTs are revolutionary,
because they provide a common market for trading receipts,
which means anyone can now access the power of the market:
it's easy for people to publish an NFT and trade it with others,
and people who purchase NFTs can always re-sell on a highly-active marketplace.
