Making money as an artist is hard.

NFTs are revolutionary,
because they provide a common market for trading digital goods,
which means anyone can now access the power of the market:
it's easy for people to publish an NFT and trade it with others,
and people who purchase NFTs can always re-sell on a highly-active marketplace.

NFTs don't require a blockchain, or a cryptocurrency.
Really they're just machine-readable receipts.
These receipts can solve the funding problem faced by digital artists,
because they allow artists to run fundraisers for their artworks...
... and then afford access to funders once the artwork is completed,
like a pre-sale.
But unlike a pre-sale,
access to the art,
or rights to reuse it,
or additional benefits like access to exclusive communities,
can be tied to the NFT,
and this can then be traded with other people,
which allows us to elevate art which has long-term social value...
... by building a market which tracks the value of art over time.
With smart contracts, these machine-readable receipts are even more powerful,
and allow artists to develop new, interactive practices for co-production:
token holders can participate in networked experiences,
collaborating with other token holders and the artist,
to become active participants in the artistic process.
These tokens, and the ownership of them,
is then automatically embedded in the artistic process,
which provides a provenance chain for ideas,
and allows automatic crediting of remixed works,
which can then be used to power automatic royalties.
Tokens can also be used to track previous contributions,
or affiliations,
creating communities of artistic practice...
... with machine-verifiable membership.
