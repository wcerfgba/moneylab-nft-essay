Making money as an artist is hard.
This is especially true for digital media artists,
whose work can be easily pirated (https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eVh9-FIQyWQ/V7o302HUHiI/AAAAAAAA1Pc/Go6y-WL_8gcj5SBQ2DL96-J3MCZzxUY3wCLcB/s1600/bandera_pirata_hacker.jpg),
because digital media are computer-based,
and anyone can copy the files and distribute them online.
Today, artists are struggling to make ends meet (https://art.ngfiles.com/images/1005000/1005372_agentslimnsexy_starving-artist.png?f1566806409),
because funding is scarce,
and because the true value of artworks are not known,
due to externalities like piracy,
and the lack of a true market system for artworks.
NFTs are revolutionary,
because they provide a common market for trading digital goods,
which means anyone can now access the power of the market (http://welkerswikinomics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/market-power-11.jpeg):
it's easy for people to mint an NFT and trade it with others (https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2021/06/How-to-Mint-an-NFT-The-Photographers-Guide-800x420.jpg),
and people who purchase NFTs can re-sell them later.
People have been trading art for a long time (https://i1.wp.com/fieneleunissen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Portfolio-webpage.jpg?fit=1056%2C672&ssl=1),
but since the rise of the Internet, a need has emerged...
... to provide digital artists with the same levels of security...
... as their counterparts who work in physical media.
NFTs don't require a blockchain, or a cryptocurrency.
Really they're just machine-readable receipts.
These receipts can solve the funding problem faced by digital artists,
because they allow artists to run fundraisers for their artworks...
... and then afford access to funders once the artwork is completed,
like a pre-sale.
But unlike a pre-sale,
access to the art,
or rights to reuse it,
or additional benefits like access to exclusive communities,
can be tied to the NFT,
and this can then be traded with other people,
which allows us to elevate art which has long-term social value...
... by building a market which tracks the value of art over time (https://socks-studio.com/2015/03/23/light-time-silence-by-keisuke-yamamoto/).
With smart contracts, these machine-readable receipts are even more powerful,
and allow artists to develop new, interactive practices for co-production:
token holders can participate in networked experiences (https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*f3ivH0qvJssf2v-qd8YLuA.png),
collaborating with other token holders and the artist,
